    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",

Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

We're often led to believe more data is always good, but gathering data invariably has a cost associated with it. Assess this trade off by seeing how performance varies with differing data set sizes.

Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "I started by removing the Big Mountain Resort entry from the training and test data. Then I separated the target variable (AdultWeekend) from the rest of the data (the 32 other numeric variables), and then divided the row entries with a 70%/30% train/test split.\n",
    "    \n",
    "I then obtained a baseline performance metrics by taking the mean of the target variable (AdultWeekend) as the estimate for every individual price. This gave an R-squared of 0 for training set and -0.003 for the test set. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was \\\\$17.92 for the training set and \\\\$19.14 for the test set.\n",
    "The linear models that used all features performed fairly well, but they were prone to overfitting. For example, the R-squared was 0.82 for the training set and 0.72 for the test set. The MAE for the test set was only \\\\$8.55, but it rose to \\\\$9.41 for the test set. This substantial difference may indicate overfitting to the training set. Indeed, later 5-fold cross-validation metrics found a cross-validated training set R-squared of 0.60 and MAE of \\\\$11.13.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation can give metrics for the training set that are more like the test set, avoiding overly-optimistic metrics that come from overfitting. For example, the linear model using 15 features attained a mean R-squared of 0.63 (Standard Deviation (SD) = 0.095) across the 5 iterations of cross-validation, even though the overfit version trained on the entire training set gave a R-squared of 0.79.  Indeed, the R-squared=0.63 cross-validated estimate was similar to the test set R-squared of 0.64 for this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then used GridSearchCV to find the optimal subset of features for a linear model, using the mean R-squared across cross-validation iterations as the scoring function. This procedure selected an 8-feature model that gave a cross-validated R-squared of 0.68 (SD=0.046) and a MAE of \\\\$10.50 (SD=1.62). Interestingly, a 6-feature model gave strong performance as well, with an R-squared of 0.68 (SD=0.067) and MAE of \\\\$10.49 (SD=1.76).\n",
    "\n",
    "The random forest model with all features as input produced the strongest cross-validated performance with an R-squared of 0.71 (SD=0.065) and MAE of \\\\$9.65 (SD=1.35), much better than the all-features linear model cross-validated performance (R-squared=0.60, MAE=\\\\$11.13).  When generalized to the test set, the random forest model’s MAE was \\\\$9.54, which approximately matched the all-feature linear model’s test set MAE of \\\\$9.41. However, the random forest model was more reliable and showed less variability. The random forest metrics were also superior to the linear model using subsets of features and superior to random forest models using subsets of features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward, I will use the 32-feature random forest model. It showed the best performance on almost all metrics. It was superior to all tested linear models and all other tested random forest models.</span>\n"
